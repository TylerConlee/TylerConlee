## Synopsis

This is the source code for my portfolio site, TylerConlee.com. Made in Node.js using Express Handlebars and SASS. 

## Motivation

This project is for me to experiment with learning new things. It serves as a playground for me to learn new methods of development, as well as display my previous work.

## Contributors

I'm open to any issues/pull requests you'd like to submit, as I'm always up for learning a new way of approaching something. If you have any questions, let me know on [Twitter - @tylerconlee](http://twitter.com/tylerconlee).
